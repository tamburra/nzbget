# nzbget
A docker container based on linuxserver/nzbget with mp4 automation

https://hub.docker.com/r/linuxserver/nzbget/

Makes a symlink from sickbeard_mp4_automator to a config directory that is a volume for the container. If the host has a config file (autoProcess.ini) in the mounted volume, then sickbeard_mp4_automator will be able to use that. This is useful if you are running multiple containers but want to share the mp4 automation configuration between them. It also has the benefit of being able to modify the config from the host OS.
